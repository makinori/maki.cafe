# maki.cafe

Built with **Next.js**

Used to be built with Angular in [old-angular](https://github.com/makinori/maki.cafe/tree/old-angular) branch

-   `pnpm install`
-   `pnpm make` generates spritesheets
-   `pnpm start` develop
-   `pnpm build && pnpm serve` deploy

I'd like to rewrite this with Vite some day to optimize everything myself
